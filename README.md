# Machine-Learning
This repository contains sample codes that are coded and test by me using Python 3 and python 4. This repository hold foundational data explaining about the things and about's it's existence and why it really matter in machine learning before actually moving into Artificial intelligence or Machine Learning field.  Understanding Why, How, Who, When, Where, What about things is necessary before getting to start working right away in any field.  Here mostly i teach myself by relating math related stuff to real life. Math is main ground for ML.
